# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker

![Design preview for the IP Address Tracker coding challenge](./src/images/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a solution to the [IP Address Tracker](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0) intermediate challenge on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

My solution can be viewed on [https://fementor-ipaddresstracker.vercel.app](https://fementor-ipaddresstracker.vercel.app) and on my [Frontend Mentor profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/GreetVdL).

For this challenge the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) was used and the map was generated using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

You can see your own IP address on the map on the initial page load and you can search for any IP addresses or domains to see the key information and location.
